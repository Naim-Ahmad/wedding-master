# React + Firebase

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

# Website Features

## Fully Responsive

Your website is designed to adapt to various screen sizes and devices, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience for visitors using desktops, tablets, or mobile phones. This responsive design allows your website's content and layout to adjust dynamically, optimizing readability and usability.

## User Registration and Login

Users can register and log in to your website directly using their Facebook or Google accounts. This provides a convenient and quick way for users to access your platform without the need to create a new account manually.

## Private Routes

Your website has three private routes, meaning that certain sections of your site are accessible only to registered and logged-in users. These routes are:

1. **Dashboard**: This is a personalized user dashboard where users can access information related to their account, services, and progress.
2. **Gallery**: A private section where users can access specific content or features that are restricted to logged-in users.
3. **Service Details**: This section likely contains detailed information about the services your website offers.

## Service Booking and Purchase

Users can hire any of the six services provided on your website. To confirm a service booking, users are required to make a cash advance payment. This payment ensures that users are serious about booking the service and helps secure their reservation.

## Service Progress Tracking

After purchasing services, users can track the progress of those services through the Dashboard. This feature provides transparency and keeps users informed about the status of the services they have booked.

## Account Information

Users can access all information related to their account, including service bookings, personal details, and possibly account settings, on the Dashboard. This central location makes it easy for users to manage and monitor their activities on your website.
